# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview
Energy consumption prediction is crucial for efficient power management, enabling energy providers to anticipate future demand and optimize supply. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.

## Features
- Time-series forecasting of energy consumption.
- Anomaly detection in energy usage.
- Clustering of consumption patterns.
- Visualization of trends and predictions.
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest Regression, Isolation Forest, K-Means Clustering
- **Deployment (Optional)**: Flask/Django, Streamlit
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL/MongoDB (if needed)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Energy-Prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- **Source**: Public energy datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository)
- **Attributes**: Datetime (timestamp), MW (energy consumption in megawatts)
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering (time-based features)

## How to Run
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. If using a web interface, start the server:
   ```bash
   flask run  # For Flask
   streamlit run app.py  # For Streamlit
   ```

## Results & Insights
- The model helps optimize power distribution and reduce energy wastage.
- Identifies seasonal variations and peak demand periods.
- Anomaly detection highlights unusual consumption patterns.

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time energy monitoring systems.
- Enhancing predictive accuracy with deep learning models.
- Deployment as a cloud-based API for industrial use.
